	Merge branches 'fix-pr11302-opensuse' and 'fix-pr11306-macosx'

	* fix-pr11302-opensuse:
	  tests: cater to systems installing libs in /lib64

	* fix-pr11306-macosx:
	  tests: fix spurious failure on Mac OS X

2012-04-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	coverage: test the internal $(am__relativize) variable

	This new coverage might turn out be useful for the planned changes
	in Automake-NG.  Even if it eventually doesn't, we gen an improved
	testsuite exposure of some non-trivial internals, so it's always a
	win for us.

	* t/relativize.tap: New test.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

2012-04-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: cater to systems installing libs in /lib64

	See automake bug#11302.

	On at least OpenSUSE 12.1, "make install" will install libraries in
	the '${prefix}/lib64'  directory by default.  This is due to the
	$CONFIG_SITE set by /etc/profile.d/site.sh, which sets a libdir
	that ends in '/lib64' rather than '/lib' if it finds that the compiler
	is generating 64-bit code.  This behaviour was causing some spurious
	failures in our testsuite.  Fix them.

	* t/posixsubst-libraries.sh: Assume the libraries are installed in
	'$(libdir)' rather than in '$(prefix)/lib'.
	* t/posixsubst-ltlibraries.sh: Likewise.
	* t/posixsubst-scripts.sh: Similarly, don't assume that '$(bindir)',
	'$(sbindir)' and '$(libexedir)' always defaults to respectively
	'$(prefix)/bin', '$(prefix)/sbin' and '$(prefix)/libexec'.
	* t/transform3.test: Likewise.

	    Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	tests: fix spurious failure on Mac OS X

	See automake bug#11306.

	* t/lex-libobj.sh: We used to pass LEXLIB='-L /lib' to the ./configure
	invocation, to prevent it from explicitly searching for a "lex library".
	But the linker on MacOS X 10.5 apparently chokes on that:

	  cc -g -O2  -o foo foo.o -L /lib yywrap.o
	  ld: file not found: /lib
	  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

	So, we now instead pass LEXLIB=' ', which being non-empty is enough
	to prevent the search of a "lex library".  And since we are at it,
	enhance comments on this non-obvious usage.

2012-04-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	coverage: parallel make with vala

	* t/vala-parallel.sh: New test.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

2012-04-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala: configure exit with status 77, not 1, if valac version is too old

	From a report by Bruno Haible in automake bug#1193.  This change should
	also automatically avoid spurious testsuite failures with older vala
	versions.

	* m4/vala.m4 (AM_PROG_VALAC): Exit with status 77, rather than 1, if
	the Vala compiler found older than the minimal required version (if
	any).  This is more consistent with what is done by other macros like
	AM_PROG_UPC or AC_PROG_CC.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* t/vala-headers.sh: Adjust, so that the test is only skipped of the
	vala compiler is too old or the required PKG_CHECK_MODULES third-party
	macro is not found by aclocal, and not if a generic error happens in
	the configure script.
	* t/vala-libs.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala2.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala3.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala5.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala-vpath.sh: Likewise (but don't check for the potential error
	with PKG_CHECK_MODULES, as that macro is not used in any way here).
	* t/vala4.sh: Adjust, to avoid the new semantic causing this test to
	skip instead of failing.

	refactor: processing of input makefile rules

	This is a pure refactoring, with no intended functional or semantic
	changes.  It breaks up an overly-long function in three smaller
	sub-functions.  This change will very especially useful for the work
	on Automake-NG.

	* lib/Automake/Rule.pm (define): Move quite a lot of code out, into ...
	(_rule_defn_with_exeext_awareness, _maybe_warn_about_duplicated_target,
	_conditionals_for_rule): ... these new subroutines.

2012-04-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	automake: refactor pre-processing of makefile fragments

	This change will provide the automake script with a new function that
	reads in a Makefile fragment *without* performing Automake ad-hoc parsing,
	but only the pre-processing step, i.e., removal of '##' comments and
	substitution of tokens like '%SUBDIRS%', '%?LIBTOOL%' or '?GENENRIC?'.

	This will very likely be useful for the work on Automake-NG.

	This is a pure refactoring, with no intended functional or semantic
	changes.

	* automake.in (preprocess_file): New function, extracted ...
	(make_paragraphs): ... from here.

2012-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	docs: remove obsolete references to Autoconf 2.13

	Autoconf 2.13 is definitely obsolete today, so giving hints or caveats
	about it in the Automake documentation is not only obsolescent, but
	also counter-productive, as it suggests that autoconf 2.13 is still
	relevant.

	* doc/automake.texi: Adjust.  Related rewordings.  Since we are at it,
	prefer using a more modern autoconf version number (2.68 instead of 2.57)
	in an example showing how to correctly use 'AC_PREREQ' in third-party
	.m4 files.

2012-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure with non-ANSI terminals

	* t/ax/tap-summary-aux.sh: When checking colored testsuite output,
	be sure to export the TERM variable to the value "ansi"; otherwise
	the automake testsuite driver will not display colored output, not
	even if AM_COLOR_TESTS is exported to "always".  Failure revealed
	by NixOS Hydra.

2012-04-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	maintainer-check: fix definition of $(ams) again

	* syntax-checks.mk (ams): The previous change 'v1.11b-36-g127adfb' solved
	one problem in the definition of this variable, but also caused it contain
	the names of all the left-behind 't/*.dir' temporary test directories.
	Fix that.

2012-04-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	maintainer-check: do not hang

	* syntax-checks.mk (ams): The definition of this variable was invoking
	the 'find' utility in an incorrect way, which resulted into the variable
	being empty, thus reducing coverage in some maintainer check and making
	other hang.  Fix this.

2012-04-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	parallel-tests: 'recheck' must depend on 'all'

	Fixes automake bug#11252.

	When a developer experience one or more failures in the testsuite, a good
	workflow is for him to modify its program's sources to fix the bug thus
	revealed, run "make recheck" to verify that the change has indeed solved
	the testsuite failures previously experienced, and then run "make check"
	to verify that the change has not introduced any new failure or regression.

	Unfortunately, this apparently natural workflow couldn't have worked until
	now, since the Automake-provided 'recheck' target (which didn't depend on
	'all') wouldn't have causes the program to be recompiled, and the failed
	tests would have thus been run with the older, buggy version of the
	program, failing the same way as before.

	* lib/am/check.am (recheck): Depend on 'all'.
	* t/parallel-tests-recheck-depends-on-all.sh: New test.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.
	* NEWS: Update.

2012-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala tests: building libraries, and more on '.vapi' files

	* t/vala1.sh: Remove, turned into ...
	* t/vala-libs.sh: ... this functional test instead.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Adjust.

2012-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	automake: fix botched call to 'check_user_variables'

	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): The 'check_user_variables' function
	takes an array, not an array ref, as argument; adjust its call accordingly.

2012-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala: cleanup rules are better and more complete now

	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Ensure Vala-generated C sources
	and header files and our custom stamp files are correctly cleaned.
	* t/vala-headers.sh, t/vala-vpath.sh: Enhance.
	* NEWS: Update.

2012-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala tests: check headers generation

	* t/vala-headers.sh: New test, checking use of 'valac' options for
	header generation (e.g., '-H', '--vapi', ...) in '$(..._VALAFLAGS)'.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

2012-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala tests: remove redundant libtool requirements and usages

	* t/vala2.sh: Don't require libtool m4 macros, don't run libtoolize,
	don't invoke AC_PROG_LIBTOOL: none of there is really needed.
	* t/vala3.test: Likewise.

2012-04-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala tests: some enhancements

	* t/vala-vpath.sh, t/vala2.sh, t/vala3.sh, t/vala5.sh: Enhance a little.

2012-04-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala tests: few adjustments and improvements

	* t/vala4.sh: Don't run 'libtoolize', it's not truly required.
	($required): Don't require 'libtoolize'.
	(configure.ac): Don't invoke 'AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'.
	* t/vala-mix.sh ($required): Require 'cc'.
	Avoid some calls to 'framework_failure_', they were only useful when
	this test was xfailing (to ensure it wasn't failing for the wrong
	reasons).
	Ensure the stamp file is created in the source directory.

2012-04-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: use latest help2man, but without locale support

	* doc/help2man: Update to latest (1.40.8), but built with
	--disable-nls, which elides the less-portable locale-related
	code, and with the "use 5.008" manually changed to "use 5.006".

2012-04-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: use slightly older help2man, for improved portability

	Fixes automake bug#11235

	* doc/help2man: Downgrade to help2man-1.36.4, so that it does

2012-04-13  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	install: shell parameter expansions can be used in directory names

	Fixes automake bug#11232.

	GNU automake used to support shell parameter expansion and command
	substitutions in installation directories, but that was inadvertently
	broken by commit v1.11-759-g368f1c4 "install: don't create empty dirs
	when an empty 'foo_PRIMARY' is used" of 18-03-2012, where shell quoting
	of generated MKDIR_P command was changed from double to single quotes
	in 3 places, while some 21 other places still use double quotes for
	generated MKDIR_P commands.

	* lib/am/data.am: Use double quotes for generated "mkdir -p" commands.
	* lib/am/libs.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/ltlib.am: Likewise.

	* THANKS: Add entry for David Fang.

2012-04-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: generate doc/*.1 files; include help2man

	This change is required to avoid making a distributed file depend
	on a generated (non-distributed) one.  The preceding change
	introduced one such dependency, with the distributed doc/*.1
	depending on the generated aclocal and automake files.  Here,
	we avoid the problem by generating the doc/*.1 files rather than
	distributing them.

	* doc/help2man: New file, version 1.37.1.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add doc/help2man.
	(man1_MANS): Rename from $(dist_man1_MANS).  Remove $(srcdir) prefix.
	(CLEANFILES): Add these files here, rather than to
	$(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES), since we are no longer distributing them.
	(update_mans): Use doc/help2man, not $(HELP2MAN).
	* configure.ac: Don't test for help2man, now that we bundle it.

2012-04-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: avoid parallel build failures

	A parallel build would fail when two concurrent sub-make processes
	tried to build lib/Automake/Config.pm.  The loser would complain that
	  grep: lib/Automake/Config.pm-t: No such file or directory
	  chmod: cannot access `lib/Automake/Config.pm-t': No such file or\
	    directory
	  make[1]: *** [lib/Automake/Config.pm] Error 1
	* Makefile.am (update_mans): Don't build lib/Automake/Config.pm here.
	Instead, depend on it from the two rules that use it:
	($(srcdir)/doc/aclocal-$(APIVERSION).1): Depend on it.
	($(srcdir)/doc/automake-$(APIVERSION).1): Likewise.

	[ Note that technically, the above is incorrect, since it makes those
	  distributed doc/*.1 files depend on generated aclocal and automake.
	  That problem is addressed by the following commit. ]

	However, that was not enough, since even then, a parallel build
	would still fail, now with this:

	  help2man: can't get `--help' info from automake-1.11a
	  Try `--no-discard-stderr' if option outputs to stderr
	  make: *** [doc/automake-1.11a.1] Error 1

	a subsequent "make -j3" would create the missing file.
	That was because help2man would invoke t/wrap/aclocal.in and
	t/wrap/automake.in, each of which would require aclocal and
	automake, yet those two files weren't guaranteed to be created.
	Add explicit dependencies:
	($(srcdir)/doc/aclocal-$(APIVERSION).1): Depend on aclocal.
	($(srcdir)/doc/automake-$(APIVERSION).1): Depend on automake.

	maintcheck: avoid yet more spurious failures (2)

	Some maintainer checks were too greedy in processing 'Makefile.am'
	files, looking for them even in temporary directories left behind
	by the test cases, thus causing occasional spurious failures.

	* syntax-checks.mk (ams): Ignore 'Makefile.am' files in the
	temporary test directories.

2012-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	maintcheck: avoid yet more spurious failures (1)

	The 'sc_tests_makefile_variable_order' maintainer check is too
	strict sometimes, blaming automake for outputting out-of-order
	variables when this is in fact due to the result of post-processing
	of third-party tools or custom test code.

	* t/tap-doc2.sh: Ensure the final Makefile.in (that we hack by
	hand) is removed, to avoid a spurious maintainer-check failure.

	(sc_ensure_testsuite_has_run): The 'test-suite.log' file created by

	tests: rename 'tests/' => 't/', '*.test' => '*.sh'

	When we (soon) convert the Automake testsuite to a non-recursive
	make setup, we'll have to fix the entries of $(TESTS) to be
	prepended with the subdirectory they are in; this will increase
	the length of $(TESTS), and thus increase the possibility of
	exceeding the command-line length limits on some systems (most
	notably, MinGW/MSYS).  See automake bug#7868 for more information.

	Thus we rename the 'tests/' subdirectory to 't/', and each 'x.test'
	script in there to 'x.sh'; this way, the $(TESTS) entry 'foo.test'
	will become 't/foo.sh', which have the same number of characters.

	maint: remove most recursion in automake's own build system

	Recursive make-based build systems tend to be slower, more fragile
	and less faithful than "flat" ones.  See Peter Miller's article
	"Recursive Make Considered Harmful" for more a more in-depth
	discussion:

	    <http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/books/rmch/>

	While in the case of automake this isn't a big problem (given the
	small size of its build systems), it still creates occasional
	glitches and annoyances.

	With this change, the use of recursion in Automake's own build
	system is eliminated *but for the testsuite*.  Converting that
	is a little more tricky, and better left for a later change (or
	series of changes).

	See also commit v1.11-769-gfeeb7f6 of 28-03-2012.

	* contrib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am, m4/Makefile.am,
	doc/Makefile.am:  Removed, their content merged ...

	texinfo: warn about future use of '--tidy'

	Starting from the next major release of Automake (likely 1.13) we
	want to start passing the '--tidy' option to texi2dvi and texi2pdf
	invocations, so that auxiliary TeX-generated files can be kept
	around (thus speeding up rebuilding of DVI and PDF output) without
	cluttering the build directory too much.

	Since the '--tidy' option was introduced in Texinfo 4.9 (as
	documented in the Texinfo distribution's NEWS file), this also
	means that Makefiles generated by future Automake versions will
	require at least that version of Texinfo (at the time of writing
	four years and nine months old).

	The users should be warned about the planned behavioral change
	and the new version requirement it will entail.

	See also automake bug#11146.

	* NEWS (Planned Backward Incompatibilities): Add entry about use
	of the '--tidy' option and requirement of Texinfo 4.9.

	texinfo: don't clutter the builddir when using modern texi2dvi

	In modern versions of texi2dvi (at least since version 1.135, which
	comes with Texinfo 4.13) the '-o' option does not imply anymore the
	'--clean' option.  As a consequence, lots of TeX-generated auxiliary
	files are now left in the build directory by the 'pdf', 'ps' and
	'dvi' rules.

	This is especially annoying with non-recursive setups having the
	'.texi' files in a subdirectory, as in:

	  info_TEXINFOS = doc/foo.texi

	In this case, the stray auxiliary files are left in the top build
	directory (since TeX is run from there).  See for example:

	 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bison/2012-04/msg00002.html>

	See also automake bug#11146.

	'--clean' option.  Update comments accordingly.
	* tests/txinfo-noclutter.test: New test.

	acinstall: remove, it has never been really used

	Accordingly to the git history (see for example the 'README-alpha'
	in commit 'Release-1-1e-39-g9beb4ec' of 06-10-1996), the 'acinstall'
	script should have been used to install m4 files for aclocal.  The
	comments in this script report that "... A script is needed to do
	this because we want to do serial-number checking; newer versions
	of macro files should always be preferred".

	But the 'acinstall' script has never been really used: for example,
	the entry "actually use acinstall program" was removed (unfixed)
	from the TODO file in commit 'Release-1-1k-12-g1201405' of
	08-12-1996, and the only citation of 'acinstall' in the manual was
	removed in commit 'Release-1-1l-37-g128c3d7' of 19-03-1997, and
	never added back. In addition, the last non-trivial edit to the
	script (that is, besides updates to the copyright notice) dates
	back to 1996.

	More importantly, now that aclocal supports the ACLOCAL_PATH
	environment variable, installing m4 files directly in the
	system-wide acdir is discouraged, and better left only to
	distros' package managers (which already have their own way to
	do so, with which third-party build systems should not directly
	meddle).

	So we just remove the 'acinstall' script.

	depcomp: support tcc (Tiny C Compiler)

	This change fixes automake bug#11007.

	Since git commit 0c928da9 of 21-06-2010, "tcc: Draft suppoprt for
	-MD/-MF options" (sic, with typo in summary line), tcc has supported
	automatic dependency generation with a command-line interface
	similar to what old (pre-8.0) Intel compilers did.  This caused
	Automake-generated code for automatic dependency tracking to
	recognize tcc dependency style as "icc".  However, the format of
	the dependency files generated by tcc is apparently different enough
	from that of icc to cause spurious failures in the post-processing
	operated by our 'depcomp' script on such files.

	The failure was exposed with the development version of tcc 0.9.26
	(as installed with debian package "tcc 0.9.26~git20120104.83d") by
	test case 'depcomp-auto.tap' (available only in the master branch).

	* lib/depcomp (icc): Cater to tcc as well.  Update comments
	accordingly.
	* NEWS: Update.

	tests: workaround for automatic linker determination and conditionals

	See automake bug#11089.

	Automake is not very smart in automatically determining the command
	to be used to link a program whose source files' languages are
	conditionally defined.  For example, an input like:

	  if HAVE_CXX
	  foo_SOURCES = more.c++
	  else
	  foo_SOURCES = less.c
	  endif

	will cause the build rules for 'foo' to *unconditionally* use the
	C++ compiler for linking, even when the 'HAVE_CXX' conditional
	evaluates to false (which might mean that no C++ compiler is
	available).

	This behaviour is not really correct, but it's easy enough to work
	around, and it's only relevant for fringe use cases (at best).  So
	let's just test that the workaround really works.

	* tests/link_cond.test: New test.
	* tests/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

	maint: update TODO file

	We don't have to make creation of $(foodir) conditional when
	foo_PRIMARY is conditionally defined; that has been solved in
	a more sweeping way by commit v1.11-759-g368f1c4 of March 18,
	which solved bug#11030 and bug#10997.

	The "check" target already depends on the "all" target.

	Remove comment "investigate problems with conditionally defined
	libraries"; it is aimed at automake 1.5 (!) and too terse and old
	to be useful now.

	Remove the 12 years old suggestion that "distcheck should make sure
	that each file that uses _() is listed in POTFILES.in"; this is
	handled by gnulib-provided syntax check 'sc_po_check' already today.

	Don't tell to "Run automake before libtool"; automake does not
	automatically run libtool anymore today.

	Remove hint about the possibility to "rewrite automake in guile" or
	"add a GUI": we are not going to do so.

	The automatic de-ANSI-fication feature has already been remove, so
	no need to suggest its potential removal in the future.

	Remove reference to a prospective "cvs" option that could add some
	cvs-specific rules.  First of all, CVS is falling out of use today.
	Secondly, and most to the point, instead of guessing which VCS
	is going to be most popular and try to hack support for it into
	automake, we should leave it to developer-specific makefile
	fragments offered by projects like Gnulib to provide such rules
	(they are already doing so with succcess).

	About DOS support: it should actually be dropped, not extended.

	Add link about Karl Berry's proposal of preferring HTML over Info
	documentation installed in the local system:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/texinfo-devel/2012-03/msg00018.html>

	Remove items about "beautification" of output Makefile.in; they
	are pretty obvious, and mostly noise (after all, everybody prefers
	clean output where possible).  Leave it to any developer doing
	future refactorings to find out low-hanging and/or high-impact
	optimizations and beatifications of the generated Makefiles.

	Remove item about internationalization: we're not going to
	implement it.

	Remove an item explicitly marked as "not that it matters".

	The order of files in a distribution tarball does not really
	matter, nobody has ever complained about it, so do not worry
	about it.

	Remove the suggestions about allowing hierarchy of dirs to share
	one aclocal.m4 and about printing full file name of Makefile.am
	or configure.in when giving error, in order to help very large
	trees: nobody has ever complained about the current behaviours,
	so no real need to change them.

	install: don't create empty dirs when an empty 'foo_PRIMARY' is used

	Fixes automake bug#11030 and bug#10997.

	An empty declaration of "foo_PRIMARY" in a Makefile.am used to
	cause the generated install rules to create the directory $(foodir)
	anyway, even if nothing was to be installed there.

	While this could be seen as a convenient way to create a $(foodir)
	directory upon "make install" (respecting $(DESTDIR) settings and
	such), it also caused problems with conditionals; for example, an
	input of:

	  if FALSE
	  pgkdata_DATA = something
	  endif

	caused the generated install rules to unconditionally create the
	$(pkgdatadir) directory (see automake bug#10997).

	Also, a user wanting to create an empty directory upon installation
	can easily do so with a custom install hook, as in:

	  installdirs-local:
	          $(MKDIR_P) $(DESTDIR)$(foodir)
	  install-data-hook: installdirs-local

	On the other hand, the old behavior of "always create $(foodir),
	even if 'foo_PRIMARY' is empty" was harder and more tricky to
	override.

	Thus, from now on, an empty declaration of "foo_PRIMARY" will not
	cause the directory $(foodir) to be created upon "make install"
	anymore.

	Older GNU m4 versions (e.g., 1.4.6) did error reporting at the end

	tests: avoid spurious failures in get-sysconf.test

	This change fixes the last bit of automake bug#10866.

	* tests/get-sysconf.test: When Homebrew spawns a build, even if
	from a project's VCS, it stages the files in a new temporary
	directory, instead of building directly from a VCS checkout.
	This behaviour was causing a spurious failure in this test, which
	expected to find either a ChangeLog file or a .git directory in
	the source directory (the former happening when the test was run
	from a distribution tarball, the latter when it was run from a
	git checkout).  The Homebrew issue shows that these expectations
	are not truly warranted, so relax the test to just give a warning,
	not a failure, in case they do not hold.  Since we are at it, fix
	an unrelated weakness in the displaying of the git log, which
	could have failed when the builddir was not a subdirectory of the
	srcdir.

	Merge branch 'msvc' into maint

	This merge remedies the confusing situation that some changes
	destined for both the master branch and the release branch (a.k.a.
	branch-1.11) currently needs to be made on the non-obvious msvc
	branch and not on the more natural maint branch.  This has caused
	a seemingly endless string of less than optimal commits.

	The reason for the confusion stems from the fact that the changes made
	on the msvc branch became too radical and was considered only suitable
	for the master branch, and was thus written in a form suitable for
	master and then merged there.  Later, the msvc branch was merged
	directly into branch-1.11, in order to rush the new features to the
	market and to keep the released scripts (lib/ar-lib, lib/compile and
	lib/depcomp) consistent with those on the master branch.  However,
	some changes had to be made to the features added by the msvc branch
	in order for them to fit the requirements of branch-1.11, notably that
	the warnings issued in the extra-portability class cannot be enabled
	by -Wall in the 1.11.x maintenance releases.

	In retrospect, it would have been better to not merge msvc directly

	tests: do not clobber the $CC set by AM_PROG_CC_C_O

	If $CC is originally a losing compiler, AM_PROG_CC_C_O will

	self checks: relax tests on cleanup

	Some find(1) implementations have problems operating recursively on
	directories having subdirectories with null permissions, even when
	the permissions of such subdirectory should be fixed by find before
	it descends into them; for example, with this setup:

	  % mkdir a a/b
	  % chmod 000 a/b

	a command like this:

	  % find a -type d ! -perm -700 -exec chmod u+rwx '{}' ';'

	fails with this diagnostic on MacOS X 10.7:

	  find: a/b: Permission denied

	and with this diagnostic on Solaris 10:

	  find: cannot read dir a/b: Permission denied

	The problem is that our self checks were simply demanding too much
	from our cleanup trap: our tests never use subdirectories with null
	permissions, so it doesn't matter if the cleanup trap fails to
	handle those.  Just relax the self checks to avoid such useless
	testsuite noise.

	* tests/self-check-cleanup.tap: Only try directories missing
	write permissions, not with null permission.  That should be
	enough for our usages.

	tests: looks for GNU compilers at configure time

	This way, if the generic C compiler determined configure time is
	recognized to be the GNU C compiler, we can reuse it instead of
	looking for a compiler named "gcc" (over and over again) in the
	test scripts requiring the GNU C compiler.  Ditto for the C++,
	Fortran, and Fortran 77 compilers.

	This change will improve coverage by allowing us to more easily
	use non-default GNU compilers throughout the testsuite.

	And as a bonus, this change also removes a weakness from our
	testsuite that could cause spurious failures when flags passed
	to the generic compilers were erroneously reused for the GNU
	compilers; see automake bug#10859.

	* configure.ac: Look for the GNU compilers explicitly.  Improve
	some configure output and diagnostic since we are at it.
	* tests/defs-static.in ($GNU_CC, $GNU_CXX, $GNU_FC, $GNU_F77):
	Initialize with the values determined at configure time (while
	allowing user overrides).
	* tests/Makefile.am (do_edit): Also substitute the configure-time
	values of GNU_CC, GNU_CXX, GNU_FC and GNU_F77.
	* tests/defs (gcc, g++, gfortran, g77): Use the values for the GNU
	compilers determined at configure time (i.e., $GNU_CC for the GNU
	C compiler, and so on).

	spy: "rm -f" and "rm -rf" without args are portable

	According to recent testing by Eric Blake, it seems that all
	non-museum rm(1) implementations don't complain if called without
	file operands, *if* the '-f' option is used.  This behaviour will
	likely be mandated by future versions of the POSIX standard as
	well.

	We'd like to start assuming this rm(1) behaviour in future Automake
	releases, in order to simplify some automake-provided cleanup rules.
	So, for the moment, we add a new "spy" test in our test suite, to
	try ensuring that all the rm(1) implementation we encounter "in the
	wild" truly behaves as expected in this regard.

	For more references, see this discussion on the bug-autoconf list:
	 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2012-02/msg00002.html>
	which sprang from coreutils bug#10819:
	 <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=10819>
	and brought to the POSIX issue#542:
	 <http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=542>
	which has been accepted and will ensure that future version of the
	POSIX standards will mandate that 'rm' shouldn't complain if called
	without file operands, when the '-f' option is in use.

	* tests/spy-rm.test: New test.
	* tests/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

	least since autoconf 2.50).

	Most of the test cases changed by this commit have been

	automake: new option 'serial-tests'

	Currently, automake offers a 'parallel-tests' option to enable the
	use of the parallel testsuite harness in the generated Makefiles,
	but no option to explicitly state the intention of using the older
	serial testsuite driver (which is currently the default).

	This makes the parallel test harness seems like a second-class
	citizen (while actually it should be the other way around); more
	importantly, it will prevent us from making the parallel harness
	be the default one in future automake versions, since the users
	of the serial harness would then have no way to instruct automake
	to continue using it.

	We solve all of this by introducing a new 'serial-tests' option.

	parallel-tests: fix another BSD parallel make issue

	When BSD make is run in parallel mode, it apparently strips any

	tests: fix many spurious failures in VPATH builds

	The 'is' helper script, used by some test cases since commit
	'v1.11-1830-g96401cb' of 08-02-2012, "tests: better way to compare
	lists in Makefile rules", is not available in VPATH builds, since
	it resides in $(srcdir), nor in $(builddir), and only $(builddir)
	is added to $PATH in the test script.  This was causing spurious
	failures.

	Solve this issue by re-organizing a bit the layout and placing of
	wrapper and help scripts used by the testsuite.  This reorganization
	is by no mean complete, but should be enough to solve the VPATH
	issues.

	* tests/is: Moved ...
	* tests/ax/is: ... here
	* tests/automake.in: Moved ...
	* tests/wrap/automake.in: ... here.
	* tests/aclocal.in: Moved ...

	tests: relax a test to cater to NetBSD make

	* tests/parallel-tests-empty-testlogs.test: When $(TESTS) is empty,
	NetBSD 5.1 make ends up defining $(TESTS_LOGS) to ".log" rather than
	to the empty string (as would be expected).  This behaviour was
	causing a check in this test case to fail.  But that check was in
	fact overly strict, since our recipes are smart enough to work
	around the botched-up substitution.  Also, the failure wasn't a
	regression from Automake 1.11, since that version too would have
	triggered the same error with NetBSD 5.1 make.  So we just relax
	the test a little to avoid extra noise in the testsuite.

	tests: TAP-based tests should error if no plan was specified

	After this change, it will still be OK for TAP-based tests not to
	report any explicit TAP plan -- but they should state *explicitly*
	that they want to do so, by calling the 'plan_' function with a
	proper argument (currently, either "later" or "unknonwn").

	Motivated by a recent issue introduced by yesterday's commit
	'v1.11-1959-g0699a84' (pointed out by Peter Rosin, and fixed
	by follow-up commit 'v1.11-1961-gea44190').

	* tests/tap-functions.sh (plan_): Get rid of '$have_tap_plan_',
	and refactor use and initialization of '$planned_' in a way that
	will allow client script to get more information on which kind
	of plan (if any) has been declared by the former 'plan_' invocation.
	(skip_all_): Adjust.
	* tests/defs (exit trap): Only print the "lazy" TAP plan if 'plan_'
	has requested that *explicitly*.
	* syntax-check.mk (sc_tests_tap_plan): Remove: it's obsolete now,
	since a TAP-based test that doesn't call 'plan_' explicitly won't
	print any TAP plan, and the TAP driver will catch that and report
	an error.
	(syntax_check_rules): Adjust.

	depcomp tests: fix up today's botched commit

	Today's commit 'v1.11-1959-g0699a84' has caused the generated
	'depcomp*.tap' tests to call the 'plan_' function *before* it is
	defined, and has also caused the extra checks required for better
	libtool coverage to be run only when libtool is *not* in use,
	rather than the other way around.  Fix this mess.

	Report by Peter Rosin.

	* tests/gen-testsuite-part: Include './defs' in the generated

	tests: avoid ksh bug for wildcards in EXTRA_DIST

	Some shells, like NetBSD 5.1 /bin/ksh, have a bug that causes
	wildcards resulting from an unquoted parameter expansion not to
	be expanded as expected in some cases:

	    $ touch a b c d
	    $ /bin/sh -c 'var="[ab]" && echo $var' # As expected.
	    a b
	    $ /bin/ksh -c 'var="[ab]" && echo $var' # Oops.
	    [ab]
	    $ /bin/ksh -c 'var="?" && echo $var' # But this as expected.
	    a b c d

	This was causing a failure in our testsuite.  Work around that.

	See also:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2012-02/msg00149.html>

	"make distcheck", and fix a minor bug in the process.  But continue
	using a "bare" wildcard expression in EXTRA_DIST, without involving
	the $(wildcard) builtin, to ensure coverage of similar usages "in
	the wild".

	tests: truly use Lex and Yacc selected by configure

	When 'yacc-work' was merged into 'yl-work-for-master' in commit
	v1.11-1910-ge6c40d4 (12-02-2012), the values for $YACC and $LEX
	stopped being substituted directly by config.status, and started
	being substituted by a Makefile rule using the contents of the
	$(YACC) and $(LEX) makefile variables.

	Unfortunately, our configure.ac was calling AM_SUBST_NOTMAKE on
	'YACC' and 'LEX' (see commit v1.11-284-g34ca92b of 29-01-2011,
	"tests: don't define YACC and LEX in the Makefiles", for a
	rationale), so that the $(YACC) and $(LEX) in the Makefile simply
	hold the default make-provided values (that is, "yacc" and "lex"
	respectively), independently of what yacc and lex programs were
	defined at configure time.

	Apart from reducing coverage and creating confusion, this behaviour
	also caused spurious failures on systems lacking a yacc and/or lex
	programs.

	Problem reported by Peter Rosin.  References:
	 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2012-02/msg00131.html>

	tests: increase coverage for depcomp tests

	On platforms requiring that no undefined symbols exist in order
	to build shared libraries (e.g. Windows DLLs), you have to
	explicitly declare that the libtool library you are building
	does not actually have any undefined symbols, for libtool to
	even try to build it as a shared library.  Without that
	explicit declaration, libtool falls back to a static library
	only, regardless of any --enable-shared flags etc.

	tests/depcomp.sh (Makefile.am): Add -no-undefined if a libtool
	library (.la) is built.

	tests: fix spurious failures due to missing 'yywrap()' function

	The AC_PROG_LEX Autoconf macro does not diagnose a failure to find
	the "lex library" expected to provide a 'yywrap' function (function
	which is required to link most lex-generated programs).  On the
	contrary, when all the link attempts (i.e., with '-ll' and '-lfl')
	fail, configure declares that no lex library is needed, and simply
	proceeds with the configuration process -- only for the build to
	possibly fail later, at make time.

	This behaviour is intended; the Autoconf manual reads:

	  You are encouraged to use Flex in your sources, since it is
	  both more pleasant to use than plain Lex and the C source it
	  produces is portable.  In order to ensure portability, however,
	  you must either provide a function 'yywrap' or, if you don't use
	  it (e.g., your scanner has no '#include'-like feature), simply
	  include a '%noyywrap' statement in the scanner's source.

	This AC_PROG_LEX behaviour is causing some spurious failures of
	the Automake testsuite in environments which lack a proper library
	providing 'yywrap' (this happens for example on Fedora-based
	systems).   The proper workaround is to simply provide a fall-back
	implementation of 'yywrap' in our lexers.

	See also similar commits 'v1.11-546-gca0ba5d' (24-10-2011),
	'v1.11-1085-gb5c3968' (24-10-2011) and 'v1.11-871-geb147a1'

	depcomp tests: avoid redundant runs for libtool tests

	When running libtool-oriented tests, our 'depcomp.sh' script used
	to run the same checks thrice: once after having run configure
	with the '--disable-shared' option, once after having run it with
	the '--enable-shared' option, and once by allowing configure to
	automatically select which kind of library (or libraries) to build.

	This was done to offer extra coverage for the less-common depmodes
	(like "aix" of "hp2") where the name of the compiler-generated
	depfiles can depend on whether libtool is in use *and* on which
	kind of libraries libtool is building (static, shared, or both).
	About this, see commit 'Release-1-10-24-ge89ec38' of 28-03-2007,
	"* lib/depcomp (aix): Rewrite depmode in the spirit of the tru64
	one".

	But that extra coverage came at the price of *considerably* slowing
	down the depcomp libtool-oriented tests, since for each of them the
	tested source tree was configured and built *twelve* times (rather
	than "just" four as it is for the non-libtool case).

	So, to strike a balance between coverage and speed, we now run the
	libtool-oriented tests with the three different configuration modes
	*only* when it is possible that the depmode that will get selected
	is one of those which can actually benefit from the extra coverage.

	* tests/depcomp.sh: Adjust to only run the threefold libtool tests
	when that can truly be potentially useful.  Add related explanatory
	comments.

	tests: avoid wrong skips in dist-formats.tap

	* tests/dist-formats.tap: The test checking whether the 'compress'
	program is actually capable of compressing files relied on the
	assumption that 'compress' exits with status zero if no problem
	occurs; alas, this reasonable assumption doesn't hold in practice,
	since 'compress' does (and is documented to) exit with status 2 if
	the output is larger than the input after (attempted) compression!
	Fix this by using and input that 'compress' can actually reduce in
	size when compressing.
	Do some related reformatting of surrounding code since we are at it.

	tests: better way to compare lists in Makefile rules

	With this commit, we introduce a new helper shell script for use
	in the testsuite, which is meant to allow the test cases to easily
	check whether two whitespace-separated lists are equal; this ability
	is particularly useful to check for equality of the contents of make
	variables that are expected to contain multiple whitespace-separated
	words, and are defined through line continuations (or are rewritten
	by automake in this way), or that contain expansion of potentially
	empty variables.

	Before this change, a test checking that an usage like this one:

	  VAR = valA
	  if COND1
	    VAR += val1 # com1
	  endif COND1
	  VAR += valC

	worked as expected, couldn't use rules like:

	  ## Doesn't work because $(VAR) expands to multiple words
	  verify:
	      test $(VAR) = "valA val1 valC"

	nor like:

	  ## Doesn't work because the final expansion of $(VAR) contains
	  ## repeated contiguous whitespace characters (it actually
	  ## equals "valA val1  valC", not "valA val1 valC"), and this
	  ## is an internal detail which might change and which we don't
	  ## want to explicitly rely on.
	  verify:
	      test "$(VAR)" = "valA val1 valC"

	Instead, we had to rely on cumbersome workaround such as:

	  ## This works, but is ugly.
	  verify:
	      test "`echo $(VAR)`" = "valA val1 valC"

	or:

	  ## This works, but is even uglier.
	  verify:
	      echo BEG: $(VAR) :END | grep "BEG: valA val1 valC :END"

	Now, with the help of the new 'is' script, we can perform such a
	check in a clearer and more straightforward way, as in:

	  ## Works, and reads clearly.
	  verify:
	      is $(VAR) == valA val1 valC

	* tests/is: New helper shell script, telling whether two whitespace
	separated lists are equal.

	tests: improve and rework tests on dependency tracking

	Fixes automake bug#10434.  Suggestion by Peter Rosin.

	The 'depcomp.tap' test case worked by trying to unconditionally
	force the compiler in use by the testsuite to use, one by one, *all*
	the dependency modes known by the 'depcomp' script, and, for each
	such forced mode that was compatible enough with said compiler not
	to cause breakage in the basic compilation rules, checking that it
	was *also* good enough not to break remake rules in VPATH builds.

	This seemed a good approach when this test was first introduced, as
	it apparently increased coverage for the less used and less tested
	dependency-tracking modes.  But in the log run it turned out the
	approach was actually in part too brittle, causing some annoying
	spurious failures (as with the Tru64 depmode forced on GCC, see
	automake bug#10434), and partly too forgiving, since, for some of
	the more corner-case dependency modes, the 'depcomp' script simply
	reverts to silently disabling dependency tracking when an error is
	encountered (this happened e.g., with the Tru64 depmode forced on
	the Sun C compiler 5.9), so that a passing test means nothing, and
	only gives a false sense of security.

	As Peter Rosin put it, "it's just dead wrong to assume that feeding
	-M or -xM to the compiler (or whatever other random stuff 'depcomp'
	might do) and not get an error is the same as dependencies magically
	appearing".

	So we get rid of this wrong approach, and in the process proceed to
	a complete overhaul of many of the tests on automatic dependency
	tracking, extending the offered coverage and rationalizing their
	organization.

	* tests/depcomp.sh: New helper script, used by several new
	autogenerated tests.
	* tests/gen-testsuite-part: Generate several tests based on the
	new 'depcomp.sh' script.  Emit makefile code that declares their
	dependency on that script, and that extends EXTRA_DIST in order

	dryrun: fix regression with '$(am__make_dryrun)'

	In commit v1.11-683-gda0964e of 05-02-2012, we introduced a new
	variable '$(am__make_dryrun)' that could be used in recipes to
	determine whether make is running in dry mode (e.g., as with
	"make -n").  Unfortunately, the idiom we used fails to take into
	account the case in which $(MAKEFLAGS) contains one or more variable
	definitions whose value is a whitespace-separated list; for example,
	if we invoke make as:

	  make check TESTS="n1.test n2.test"

	then the better make implementations out there (at least modern
	GNU make and BSD make) will export MAKEFLAGS to the following
	value:

	  TESTS=n1.test\ n2.test

	So a shell loop like the one we used in $(am__make_dryrun):

	  for flag in $$MAKEFLAGS; do ...

	won't behave as expected: the shell word-splitting rules will break
	up the entry for TESTS into the two distinct entries "TESTS=n1.test\"
	and "n2.test", and this second entry will goad our $(am__make_dryrun)
	code into thinking that make is performing a dry run!

	So now we simply loop over the expanded value of $(MAKEFLAGS).
	This solves the regression, but alas, is more brittle in case the
	users passes on the command line a macro value containing unbalanced
	" or ' quotes, or shell metacharacters like, say, '`' or '('.  This
	should almost never happen though, so we don't worry about it now;
	we will revisit the issue only when and if we receive bug reports in
	this area.

	tests: work around bug#7884 in many yacc/lex tests

	Due to automake bug#7884, many test cases on Yacc/Lex support are

	refactor: new variable telling whether make is running in "dry mode"

	We define a new variable '$(am__make_dryrun)', that can be used
	in recipes to determine whether make is running in "dry mode" (as
	with "make -n") or not.  This is useful in rules that invoke make
	recursively, and are thus executed also with "make -n" -- either
	because they are declared as dependencies to '.MAKE' (NetBSD make)
	or because their recipes contain the "$(MAKE)" string (GNU and
	Solaris make).

	tap/perl: handle missing or non-executable scripts better

	This change improves how our Perl-based TAP driver handles
	non-runnable test scripts (meaning they might be not executable,
	or not readable, or even not exist).  In particular, it makes the
	driver deterministically display a clear "ERROR" result instead
	of possibly dying with diagnostic from 'TAP::Parser' internals,
	and prevents it from displaying spurious "missing TAP plan" errors.

	Moreover, with this change, some testsuite failures present only
	with newer perl versions (e.g., 5.14) are fixed.  See automake
	bug#10418.

	* tests/tap-bad-prog.tap: When testing the perl implementation of
	the TAP driver, and when the perl interpreter offers a good-enough
	'IPC::Open3::open3' function, expect it not to display spurious
	"missing TAP plan" diagnostic if the error is actually due to a
	non-runnable test script.
	* lib/tap-driver.pl (start): Removed, broken up into ...
	(setup_io): ... this ...
	(setup_parser): ... and this, which now tries to catch and report
	errors in launching the test scripts.

	tests: avoid spurious failure of 'transform2.test' on Cygwin

	On newer Cygwin versions (at least 1.7.x), the 'transform2.test'
	test has been failing spuriously; the gist is the following:
	some *purposefully* rigged install rules there try something
	like:

	  install bla.exe .../inst/bin/foo.exe
	  install script.sh .../inst/bin/foo

	and the second install command fails (trying to overwrite the
	'.../inst/bin/foo.exe' file, likely due to overly aggressive
	appending of '.exe' suffix when copying/renaming Windows
	executables).  Since this is a Cygwin issue rather than an
	Automake one (and since the use case we are testing is a really
	corner-case anyway, making it unworthy to attempt to work
	around it in automake proper), we simply hack the test case
	to avoid the failure.

	tests: work around MinGW/MSYS issue in fd redirections

	Some checks on $(AM_TESTS_FD_REDIRECT) were failing on MSYS, likely
	because system calls like "write(9, ...)" simply doesn't work for
	MinGW-compiled programs.  Similar usages work for the shell scripts
	though, since /bin/sh is an MSYS program and thus is a lot more
	POSIX-ish than most MinGW-compiled programs.

	The best fix for this issue is to separate the checks using shell
	scripts as dummy test cases from the checks using compiled programs
	for the same purpose, and skip these latter checks on MinGW.

	So we now reveal this breakage in a new test case, and enhance

	by moving it from the category 'portability' to the category
	'unsupported'.

	tree with proper `--build' and `--host' configure option.  And
	yes, specifying both these options (not only `--host') is indeed
	required to avoid spurious failures in corner cases.
	When you call configure with the `--host' option but without the
	`--build' option, configure tries to auto-detect whether you are
	cross-compiling or not, by trying to run a generated executable.
	That test might spuriously "succeed" in some corner cases (e.g.,
	Cygwin is able to run non-Cygwin apps).  In fact, generally, it
	can be the case that a cross-compilation is not detected as a
	cross anymore just because someone has installed an emulator; as
	an example, think of what can happen on a GNU/Linux system that
	is configured (through the use of the binfmt_misc kernel module)
	to execute PE executables (compiled for MS-DOS or Windows) through
	Wine *automatically*.  In conclusion, configure needs to be used
	as recommended in the documentation (i.e., by specifying *both*
	`--host' and `--build' instead of just one of them) to not have
	the build fall into any of a number of weird traps.
	* tests/defs (cross_compiling): Improve comments.

	test defs: allow compilers to be auto-selected on user's request

	In the recent changes, by pre-setting the required compilers for
	the `configure' scripts launched by the test scripts, we have
	slightly reduced the coverage of autoconf/automake code aimed at
	automatically detecting said compilers.  This commit restore such
	coverage, by allowing the user to instruct the testsuite *not* to
	preset the testsuite compiler(s).

	* tests/defs (cc): If $CC is set to the special value "autodetect"
	or "autodetected", don't export the configure-detected CC, CFLAGS
	and CPPFLAGS variables; rather, unset them.

	no one of those compilers is available (after all, they're only
	needed by the testsuite, not to build automake), but currently
	autoconf doesn't offer an easy way to obtain this behaviour.
	We prefer non-GNU compilers to the GNU ones, to ensure better
	coverage "in the wild".

	multilib: deprecate, will be moved to contrib

	As of 2012-01-17, according to Google codesarch, almost no active
	package is using the 'multilib' feature offered by automake.

	The only major exception seems to be GCC...  But on a closer look,
	it become clear that GCC basically carries its own version of
	multilib support.  In fact, Automake syncs its 'config-ml.in' and
	'symlink-tree' scripts from GCC; and the GCC repository contains a
	version of the 'multi.m4' file that is *more* updated than the one
	in the automake repository (the former having being modified the
	last time in 2008, the latter only in 2006).

	The 'multilib' feature was anyway hardly documented at all, only
	being briefly cited in the manual as an "obscure feature", "still
	experimental", that was only for users "familiar with multilibs"
	and which "can debug problems they might encounter".  We expect
	such users to be motivated and knowledgeable enough to make the
	minor adjustments required to start using the contrib version of
	multilib, if they really need to.

	* NEWS (Future backward incompatibility): Update.
	* doc/automake.texi: Deprecate multilib support.  State that it
	will be removed from automake core in the next major release.
	* m4/multi.m4 (AM_ENABLE_MULTILIB): Deprecate.  If called, now
	gives a proper warning in the 'obsolete' category (while still
	retaining its former behaviour for the rest).
	* tests/multilib.test: Update.
	* contrib/multilib/multi.m4: New, verbatim copy of the earlier
	version of multi.m4, without the new deprecation warning.
	* Makefile.am (fetch): Don't sync the 'config-ml.in' file nor

	Note that the bug was a minor one, since it didn't affect the

	  cmdline parsing: move into a dedicated perl module

2012-01-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	cmdline parsing: move into a dedicated perl module

	With this change, we delegate most of the automake and aclocal code
	for command-line options parsing to a new module "Automake::Getopt".
	This allows better code sharing between automake and aclocal, and
	also with Autoconf, which will sync the new module from us.  See
	also autoconf commit 'v2.68-120-gf4be358' (2012-01-17, "getopt: new
	Autom4te::Getopt module"), and this mailing list discussion:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2012-01/msg00033.html>

	This change might interact with the behaviour described in automake
	bug#7434; for example, starting from now, "automake -Wfoo --version"
	will cause automake to emit diagnostic like "unknown warning
	category 'foo'" before actually printing the version number and
	exiting.  This is not a big deal in practice, and the code sharing
	and simplifications introduced by this patch is certainly worth it.
	Still, we should revisited the issue in the future.

	* lib/Automake/Getopt.pm: New module, basically a slightly-edited
	copy of the 'lib/Autom4te/Getopt.pm' file from the autoconf devel
	repository (commit v2.68-120-gf4be358).  It defines and exports ...

	one of them ('parallel-tests-dryrun.test') in the maint branch, the
	other one ('parallel-tests-dry-run.test') in the master branch.

	Needless to say, their too-much-similar names can be a great source
	of confusion now.  Moreover, the two tests have been written during
	distinct refactorings, and are meant to exercise different code
	paths and/or usage scenarios, so that no one of them subsumes the
	other, and they should be both kept.

	Thus we simply rename both of them to avoid future confusion.

	tap: some makes in parallel mode unconditionally serialize output

	Some make implementations (among them, FreeBSD make, NetBSD make,
	and Solaris Distributed Make), when run in parallel mode, serialize
	the output from their targets' recipes unconditionally.  This has
	the nasty side effect that the user won't see the partial results
	of a TAP test until the test has terminated.  This is not something
	our TAP driver script can work around unfortunately; in fact, the
	driver is sending out its output progressively and "in sync" with
	test execution -- it is make that is stowing such output away
	instead of presenting it to the user as soon as it gets it.

	So we content ourself with working around the issue in our
	testsuite, to at least avoid failures we could do nothing to
	prevent.

	is a non-GNU make running in parallel mode.  And if Sun dmake is

	in the environment, but also if the make used in the testsuite is

	recheck: fix interaction with "make -n"

	vala: avoid potential useless remakes (minor bugfix)

	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Ensure the timestamp file
	from which the C files generated from Vala sources depend on gets
	created with a modification time that is truly older than those of
	said generated C files.  This prevents make from attempting useless
	rebuilds (which were bound to happen deterministically on systems
	with sub-second timestamp resolutions).  It is worth noting that,
	luckily, those useless rebuild ended up being a no-op, since the
	Vala compiler is careful not to update the timestamp of an output
	file if its content has not changed from the previous version.
	Still, the useless rebuilds messed up "make -q" and "make -n"
	invocations, and were technically incorrect (despite being, as
	noted, inoffensive in practice).

	Problem revealed by failure of tests vala-mix.test and vala5.test
	on a fast Solaris 10 system whose filesystem had a sub-second
	timestamp resolution.

	recheck: behave better with non-GNU make

	* automake.in (handle_tests): Also substitute '%CHECK_DEPS%' with
	the value of the '@check' array, containing the list of early
	test dependencies like '$(check_SCRIPTS)', $(check_PROGRAMS)',
	etc.
	* lib/am/check.am (recheck): Explicitly depend on '%CHECK_DEPS%'.
	(check, recheck): Unify the implementation of their recipes, with
	different code paths taken depending on the name of the target.
	This makes the implementation of "recheck" less brittle in the
	process (especially when non-GNU make and AM_MAKEFLAGS overriding
	are involved).

	check: separate .log -> .html conversion from core testsuite harness

	That feature is to be deprecated in the 1.11.x series, and removed
	from the automake core in the 1.12 release, where it will instead
	be offered in a semi-independent extra '*.am' fragment.  So let's
	start better separating the .log -> .html conversion from the "core
	code" of the parallel-tests harness.

	maintcheck: consistency of list of test scripts

	This is basically a backport of commit 'v1.11-358-g7b6ab07'
	and its follow-ups.  The possibility of easily checking that
	the list of test scripts listed in a Makefile equals that of
	the tests on the filesystem has proved itself so useful that
	it's worth taking the annoyance of backporting it to maint.

	* CheckListOfTests.am: New file, backported from master (commit
	'v1.11-1736-g083a75b') with minor adjustments.
	(maintainer-check-list-of-tests): New target, check for consistency
	between the list of tests defined in the including Makefile and the
	list of tests on the filesystem.
	(clean-maintcheck-testslist-tmp): New rule, to clean up temporary
	files that might be left around by the rules associated with the
	previous target.
	(clean-local): Depend on it.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am: Include `CheckListOfTests.am'.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check-list-of-test): New target,
	calling recursively into `tests/' and `lib/Automake/tests/',
	using ...
	(TEST_SUBDIRS): ... this new variable.
	(maintainer-check): Added dependency from the new target
	`maintainer-check-list-of-tests'.

	maintcheck: completeness check on list of tests simplified

	* CheckListOfTests.am: Simplify the recipe, accordingly to the
	assumption that all the entries in $(TEST_EXTENSIONS) and in
	$(TESTS) have an associated real test script.  This was not the
	case when we used to have some entries in $(TESTS) that were not
	real files, but rather "parameters" (sort of) for the corresponding
	$(LOG_COMPILER).  However, that usage had proven to be confusing
	and brittle, and thus removed (see commit 'v1.11-1308-g375f23d' of
	September 8 2011, "testsuite: revamp generation of autogenerated
	tests").

2012-01-15  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	maint: remove obsolete/broken maintainer targets

	* Makefile.am (git-diff): Remove.  First, we don't distribute diffs
	between an automake version and the next one anyway, so this target
	is pointless.   Moreover, its recipe has been broken for quite a
	long time now, always generating an empty diff due to the spurious
	'$(PACKAGE)' argument that was passed to the "git diff" invocation.
	(path-check): Remove.  The 'pathchk' program running in this check
	complains about any file with name longer than 14 characters, which
	is a ridiculously low limit for today standards.  Also, we already
	had several test scripts (no less than 195!) that were exceeding
	that limit, and nobody ever complained (not even on MinGW/MSYS nor
	Cygwin).

	build: improve silencing of automake build system

	In this change, we continue the silencing of the automake build

	mistake.

	dist: avoid $(distdir) removal failure on MSYS/MinGW

	This change fixes automake bug#10470.

	On MSYS (1.0.17) it is not possible to remove a directory that is
	in use, and this, together with timing issues, could cause spurious
	failures in the cleanup code of the "distcheck" recipe.  In fact,
	it should be noted that assuming a directory can be removed while
	it the CWD of a running process is a POSIX violation:

	  "If the directory is the root directory or the current working
	   directory of any process, it is unspecified whether the function
	   succeeds, or whether it shall fail and set errno to [EBUSY]."

	* lib/am/distdir.am (am__remove_distdir): If rm fails, sleep some
	seconds and retry, to give potential "pending" processes some time
	to exit and "release" the directory.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove 'distcheck-pr10470.test'.

	dist: distdir not unconditionally removed anymore for xz and lzip

	This change fixes automake bug#10444 a.k.a. bug#10448.

	The 'dist-xz' and 'dist-lzip' recipes were erroneously using
	'$(am__remove_distdir)' instead of '$(am__post_remove_distdir)'
	to cleanup the '$(distdir)'; so a "make dist" issued in a package
	using (say) gzip and xz compression would have failed to properly
	created the gzip tarball, since the distdir was unconditionally
	removed by "make dist-xz" upon its completion, instead of being
	left populated for the following "make dist-gzip".

	The problem with 'dist-xz' was introduced in the merge commit
	`v1.11-1142-g47587d1', and the problem with 'dist-lzip' was
	introduced in the merge commit `v1.11-1673-gc1b14e9'

	scripts: quote 'like this', not `like this'

	This change follows up on recent changes to the GNU coding standards.
	They now suggest that we should quote 'like this' or "like this" instead
	of `like this'; see:
	 <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Quote-Characters.html>.

	Gnulib is being changed accordingly, and Gnulib imports some files
	directly from Automake master, so change those files to use the

	diagnostics.

	tests: safer declarations of test dependencies

	To declare prerequisites common to all the tests, we now prefer to
	use the special `check_DATA' and `check_SCRIPTS' variables rather
	than "lazy" dependency declaration like "$(TEST_LOGS): DEPS ...";
	this because the latter, allowing run-time overriding of the
	TEST_LOGS variable, turned out to be subtly incomplete in some
	situations involving non-trivial inter-test dependencies.  For
	example, if the user issued a:

	    make check TESTS=libtool.test

	before the `defs-static' file was created (either explicitly or
	implicitly), a spurious errors followed, along these lines:

	 1. $(TEST_LOGS) got dynamically defined to `libtool.log';

	 2. make saw that, in the Makefile, `libtool.log' was explicitly
	    declared depending on `libtool-macros.log' and `defs-static';

	 3. somehow, make considered the dependency on `libtool-macros.log'
	   *before* considering the one on `defs-static' (which BTW is
	   perfectly legitimate on make's part);

	 4. to satisfy such a dependency, make set out to execute the
	    test `libtool-macros.test' in order to create the file
	    `libtool-macros.log';

	 5. since `libtool-macros.log' was *not* in $(TEST_LOGS), it
	    didn't appear to depend on the `defs-static' file, so make
	    didn't consider necessary to build `defs-static' before
	    running the `libtool-macros.test' script;

	 6. but that script sources `./defs-static' in order to work;
	    thus the test `libtool-macros.test' failed spuriously.

	* tests/Makefile.am ($(TEST_LOGS)): Remove explicit declaration
	of dependency on the required files/scripts; instead use ...
	(check_SCRIPTS, check_DATA): ... these new variables.

2012-01-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: skip tests on perl TAP driver if TAP::Parser is not available

	We had so far taken for granted that all the perl installations
	modern enough to correctly run automake also came with a built-in
	TAP::Parser module; unfortunately, testing on MinGW/MSYS has
	shown that this is not always true, and that a lot of spurious
	testsuite failures would take place in such a situation (see
	automake bug#10440).

	Luckily, the perl implementation of the Automake TAP driver is
	only meant to be used for prototyping and consistency checks, the
	"real" Automake TAP driver being the portable one implemented in
	awk.  So we can simply skip the affected tests on systems lacking
	TAP::Parser.

	* tests/defs (fetch_tap_driver): Skip the whole test case if
	the desired tap driver implementation is the perl one but the
	TAP::Parser module is unavailable.

	dist: do not wrap calls to 'tar' with the 'missing' script

	The `missing' script is meant to allow non-developers to build a
	package in the face of slightly-skewed timestamps (as might happen
	e.g. when the package is obtained from a VCS checkout rather than
	from a distribution tarball).  It is *not* the business of the
	`missing' script to try to provide wrappers for all the maintainer
	tools (in this case, to tool being a decent tar program).  Such
	wrapping of `tar' was not only inappropriate, but it was also
	preventing the legitimate overriding (at make runtime) of the
	`tar' program used in the creation of the distribution tarballs.

	See also automake bug#9822.

	* lib/missing: Don't try to specially wrap `tar' invocations
	anymore.
	* m4/tar.m4 (_AM_PROG_TAR): In the definitions of the `AMTAR'
	variable, do not wrap the `tar' invocation with the `missing'
	script anymore.  Instead, allow the user to override the intended
	tar program at make runtime, by defining the `TAR' environment
	variable.
	[$1 == v7]: Similarly for the definitions of the `am__tar' and
	`am__untar' variables.  Since we are at it, don't make them depend
	anymore on the definition of the obsolescent `AMTAR' variable.
	* NEWS: Update.

	parallel-tests: avoid trailing backslashes in make recipes

	The new testsuite-harness could generate recipes with a trailing
	backslash character (possibly followed by blank characters only),
	in the very common case where the user hadn't defined the special
	$(AM_TESTS_FD_REDIRECT) variable.  This caused spurious syntax
	errors with at least older bash versions (e.g., bash 2.05b), and
	could be potentially unportable to other weaker shells.

	dist: obsolete support for lzma (superseded by xz and lzip)

	The lzma utilities are today superseded by the xz utilities; in
	fact, the official site at <http://tukaani.org/lzma/> reads:

	  ``LZMA Utils are legacy data compression software with high
	    compression ratio.  LZMA Utils are no longer developed, ...
	    Users of LZMA Utils should move to XZ Utils.''

	and the existing automake manual (as of 1.11.2) already says:

	  ``dist-xz
	    Generate an 'xz' tar archive of the distribution. xz archives
	    are frequently smaller than bzip2-compressed archives. The 'xz'
	    format will soon (early 2009) displace the 'lzma' format''

	Also, the `dist-lzma' target still suffers of never-solved bugs,
	due to the too-high compression ratio its uses by default, which
	might cause an unacceptable memory consumption when one tries to
	compress or, worse, decompress the created tarballs; see also:

	Many maintainer checks in the top-level Makefile.am did some

	test defs: more granular overriding of the make program

	Before this change, the only way the user could override the make
	program used in the automake test cases was to override the $MAKE
	variable in the environment.  This had the annoying side effect of
	requiring that, whenever a non-default make program was to be used
	in the test cases, that same make program had to be used to drive
	the execution of the automake testsuite; otherwise, the recursive
	make invocations could pick up $MAKE from the environment, and use
	that instead of re-executing with the correct make.

	So, for example, if one wanted to try how Solaris /usr/ccs/bin/make
	behaved in the automake test cases, he couldn't run the testsuite
	in parallel mode, because that make lacks support for concurrent
	execution of recipes; on fast machines, this easily meant a 4x or
	higher slow-down.

	Once the problem is clear, the solution is pretty simple: allow
	the use of another variable, besides $MAKE, to override the make
	program to be used in the test cases.

	See also commit `v1.11-1318-g3ceeef4', that introduced a more
	general version of this change to the master branch.

	* tests/defs.in: Allow the make implementation to be used by the
	test cases to be overridden by the `$AM_TESTSUITE_MAKE' variable,
	in preference to the `$MAKE' variable.

	to break hyperlinks to our on-line manual.  Unfortunately, these

	maint: autogenerate ChangeLog

	Following the practice set by various other GNU projects, we start
	to automatically generate the ChangeLog file from the git commit
	messages.  This will avoid duplication (as the ChangeLog entries
	were always inserted both in the git commit message and in the
	version-controlled ChangeLog file), and potential problems with
	spurious merge conflicts (which, although greatly mitigated by
	Bruno Haible's `git-merge-changelog' helper program, have never
	been completely solved).

	* ChangeLog: Moved ...
	* ChangeLog.11:... to this.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.
	(gitlog_to_changelog_command, gitlog_to_changelog_options): New
	variables.
	(ChangeLog, am--changelog-regen-hook): New targets.
	* .gitignore: Add ChangeLog.
